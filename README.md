# OBD Record

## Overview
**OBD Record** is a SwiftUI application for logging Mustang Mach-E trips and charges which can be later viewed with the companion OBD Play application.

## Privacy Notice
OBD Record collects location information that is used to show trips you have taken and where you have charged your vehicle.

OBD Record uses your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to uniquely identify your trips and charges in either a private data store or a shared public data store used for testing purposes.  If you create and use your own data store then no sharing of you location data is possible.

However, if you choose to use a public data store for evaluation and testing then your location and other vehicle data could be viewed by anyone that knows your VIN.  Should you wish to remove your trip/charge data from view you can swipe right on each trip/charge or use the Settings.Data Sources option to remove all your data.
